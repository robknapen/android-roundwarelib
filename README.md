android-roundwarelib
====================

Roundware V1.0 library for the Android OS.

This library can be used to build Android apps that work with the Roundware V1.0 protocol. This prototol
is however superseeded by version 2.0. The new RWFramework library is available to work with this version
of Roundware, and should be preferred.
